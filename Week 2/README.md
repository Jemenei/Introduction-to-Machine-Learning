<h3>Data Types</h3>
\n
<b>Quantitative</b> data are numbers-based, countable, ot measurable.
<i>Example:</i>
<ul>
  <li>Average temperature in Almaty</li>
  <li>Number of students in a class</li>
  <li>Gross income</li>
</ul>
\n
<b>Qualitative</b> data is interpretation-baes, descriptive, and relating to language.
<i>Example:</i>
<ul>
  <li>Customers feedback</li>
  <li>Review Sentiments</li>
  <li>Survey Open-Ended Answers</li>
</ul>
\n
Features with <b>numerical data</b> represent quantitative attributes that can be measured and expressed as number.
<i>Example:</i>
<ul>
  <li>Age</li>
  <li>Income</li>
  <li>Temperature</li>
</ul>
Numerical data can futher ve divided into <b>continuous</b> and <b>discrete</b>
\n
<b>Discrete variables</b> can only take specific, distinct values, often whole numbers. These values are countable, and there are no intermediate values between them. Discrete variables are ussually related to counting:
<ul>
  <li>Number of employees in a company</li>
  <li>Number of products sold</li>
  <li>Goals scored in a football match</li>
</ul>
\n
<b>Categorical data</b> represent qualitative attributes and are often divided into distinct categories, <b>nominal</b> and <b>ordinal</b>:
<ul>
  <li>Categorical <b>nominal</b> variable consists of categories with no inherent order or ranking</li>
  <li>Categorical <b>ordinal</b> vairable includes categories with a meaningful order or ranking</li>
</ul>
